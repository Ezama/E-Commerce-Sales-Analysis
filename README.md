# E-Commerce Sales Analysis
## Project Background
This project focuses on an in-depth analysis of sales data from a fictional e-commerce company. The company operates in multiple product categories, including Groceries, Health & Beauty, Home & Garden, Fashion, and Electronics, with various marketing channels driving customer acquisitions, such as Email, Social Media, Paid Search, and Referrals.

As a data analyst at the company, my task was to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and marketing effectiveness to provide actionable insights that could inform strategy moving forward. The analysis covers revenue growth, customer segmentation, average order value (AOV), refund rates, and marketing channel performance.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Revenue Growth** 
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** 
- **Refund Rate** 
- **Marketing Channel Performance** 

## Data Structure & Initial Checks
The company’s main database consists of one primary table, which contains essential customer, order, and product information. However, to facilitate analysis, we will create and export derived tables from the main dataset. These derived tables will help to segment customers by loyalty, categorize marketing channels, and analyze refund rates by product categories, among other insights.

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
In this analysis, the company’s revenue growth rate was evaluated for the past three years, revealing a modest growth of 1.38% between 2022 and 2023 despite a small decline from 2021 to 2022. The overall average order value (AOV) remained consistent across both loyalty and non-loyalty customers, though loyalty customers contributed slightly higher values. Marketing channels such as Email and Social Media performed best in terms of revenue, while Paid Search lagged behind in terms of revenue generation and loyalty customer acquisition.

## Insights Deep Dive
### 1. Revenue Growth Rate Analysis:

* The company experienced a negative revenue growth of -0.84% from 2021 to 2022, followed by a recovery of 1.38% growth from 2022 to 2023. This suggests that efforts to drive sales were successful after a minor dip in 2021.
  
* Seasonal promotions or loyalty programs may have contributed to revenue stability despite fluctuations in market demand. However, continuous focus is needed to maintain growth.
  
### 2. Customer Segmentation (Loyalty vs. Non-Loyalty):

* The overall Average Order Value (AOV) was 96.13, with loyalty members having a slightly higher AOV (96.62) compared to non-loyalty members (96.00). This suggests that loyalty programs are effective in increasing customer spend but may need more aggressive engagement strategies to widen the gap.
  
* Loyalty members convert more effectively through marketing channels like Email (48.08% conversion rate) and Social Media (47.62%), emphasizing the importance of nurturing long-term relationships via personalized communication.

### 3. Marketing Channel Performance:
* Email marketing drove the highest revenue of $2.91M, closely followed by Social Media with $2.87M. Paid Search contributed the lowest revenue ($962K), indicating potential underperformance that may warrant further investigation.
  
* In terms of total orders, Email and Social Media also had the highest volumes, reaffirming their value as key marketing channels. Paid Search and Referral channels had significantly lower orders, impacting overall revenue generation.
  
* Loyalty customer acquisition was highest through Email (48.08%) and Social Media (47.62%). Paid Search, while cost-intensive, had the lowest loyalty conversion rate (28.23%).

### 4. Refund Rate by Product Category:
* The overall refund rate stood at 5.02%, with Groceries and Health & Beauty products having the highest refund rates at 5.19% and 5.14%, respectively. Operational issues in these categories, such as product quality or delivery timelines, could be contributing factors.
  
* Electronics had the lowest refund rate (4.77%), suggesting better quality control or customer satisfaction in this category.
    
## Recommendations:
Based on the insights and findings, the following recommendations are provided:

* Increase Focus on Loyalty Programs: The marginal difference in AOV between loyalty and non-loyalty customers suggests that current loyalty initiatives could be enhanced. Additional rewards or exclusive deals may help drive higher spending from loyalty customers.**

* Optimize Paid Search Strategy: Since Paid Search is underperforming in both revenue generation and customer acquisition, a strategic review is necessary. Consider reducing investment in Paid Search or experimenting with new ad copy and targeting strategies.**

* Improve Operations for Groceries and Health & Beauty: The higher refund rates in these categories indicate potential issues with product quality or delivery service. Streamlining fulfillment processes and enhancing quality checks could help reduce refunds.**

* Leverage High-Performing Channels: Email and Social Media channels are delivering the best results in terms of revenue and loyalty acquisition. Continue to invest in these channels, with a focus on personalization and customer engagement to drive further growth.**
